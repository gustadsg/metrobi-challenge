Think that you have an unlimited number of carrots, but a limited number of carrot types. Also, you have one bag that can hold a limited weight. Each type of carrot has a weight and a price. Write a function that takes carrotTypes and capacity and return the maximum value the bag can hold. [Python or Javascript]

Example:
carrotTypes = [{kg: 5, price: 100}, {kg: 7, price: 150}, {kg: 3, price: 70}]
capacity = 36 //kg
getMaxValue(carrotTypes, capacity)
